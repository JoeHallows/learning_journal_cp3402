# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Progress in relation to careers such as web design. Gives us increased employability of conducting more tasks. Further learning of coding using html, css and js. Detailed introduction to creating websites via WordPress, and showcased why WordPress is the most used website editor by far. 
From other student's answers to the group formation questions, I realized that, like me, many people have only light commitments such as work on weekends, but a fair majority are not as extroverted as myself. From this, it would be better to group with people I already know since so much personal ground has been covered already, making it easier to collaborate as a team. This will narrow my group preferences down considerably.
