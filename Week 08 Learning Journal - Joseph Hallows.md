# Content Insights
- Artificial intelligence via LLM (Large Language Models) are going to be an integral part of daily life in the near future!        
- The foundations of Teaching AI's Neural Networks via Machine Learning        
- PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side code. All files should be called '.php' even if there is no php code to give you freedom to add php code later without having to refactor files.      
- Variables always start with $         
- Letters, numbers, and the underscore are permitted, but the first char after $ can't be a number.        
- No spaces or hyphens for variable names, and they are case-sensitive        
# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- I can use ChatGBT to write essays, ask for summarizations of books, produce working code, and give condensed information about specific topics relatively quickly! Not all of it will be correct at this point in time, but it is becoming larger and smarter every day, showing that we are at the point of another technological peak with the birth of AI (dun dun dun).       
- Learning PHP at this stage is giving me confidence in how quickly I picked up the basics of a new coding language quickly, form syntax importance to naming variable conventions.
# Theory
I believe it's true that written notes are easier to understand when the perspective is for someone reading the notes in the not-too-distant future.       
I know this is true when I read notes I write in this perspective and understand what the notes are about, in general and specifically.     
# Results (Content & Learning Insights)
When writing notes about content, you have to dive deeper and deeper into specifics since you may think what you have just learnt will stay with you forever, but realistically in a week or so it will be difficult to recall. With this in mind, a topic must be described in detail until you explain all related specifics. No specifics can be left out, otherwise when read in the future there may be holes of understanding.       
Learning insights are that to write specific notes, you must learn all the related specifics, rather than just learning the general content basis and diving into specifics you are curious about. Sometimes it is uncertain how specific you must be, but the best target would be to describe it to someone who knows nothing about the topic.       
The theory is true, if I write notes in the perspective of someone reading it in the future, the general and specific notes are easier to understand.
