# Content Insights
- Every major piece of content usually has its own template file!       
- "functions.php" is going to be updated considerably through the development of our CMS.       
- "single.php" looks after single posts.       
- To move the order of content around in a specific php file, simply find the relevant function that looks after that content and move to the desired location.      
- To use content from other php files, find the relevant code, name a new function and add the code into the function, then move where that new function will be called to the desired location.        
- You can use ctrl + left-click to find the location of a function.      
- The colours used for links, texts, backgrounds, and borders may be changed in "_colors.scss"       
- "_typography.scss" changes fonts
