# Content Insights
- Every major piece of content usually has its own template file!       
- "functions.php" is going to be updated considerably through the development of our CMS.       
- "single.php" looks after single posts.       
- To move the order of content around in a specific php file, simply find the relevant function that looks after that content and move to the desired location.      
- To use content from other php files, find the relevant code, name a new function and add the code into the function, then move where that new function will be called to the desired location.        
- You can use ctrl + left-click to find the location of a function.      
- The colours used for links, texts, backgrounds, and borders may be changed in "_colors.scss"       
- "_typography.scss" changes fonts       
- You can use php pages to use and locate categories, tags, navigating previous/next posts, comments, specify headings, change colours, fonts, images, captions, margins, alignments, and many other aspects a website (just to name a few).

- CMS Lecture Recording:      
- Browser can only read CSS, so Sass (a meta-language) is implemented to make the developer's job easier for input of code.      
- This Sass code changes the CSS code, making it easier to follow D.R.Y (Don't Repeat Yourself), describes the style of a document cleanly and structurally, and gives the developer more power than CSS allows.      
- Sass syntax is simpler, and implements a variety of features useful to creating usable stylesheets.      
- This preprocessing using Sass allows developers to use certain variables, functions, mixins, nesting, extend/inheritance, and much more to modify CSS code.     
# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- PHP may be daunting to start off with, but once you learn the relevant php files in relation to the website pages, and understand the functions within these php files, you may edit it as desired.      
- I didn't install the global version of sass (npm install -g sass) so no matter what I did to my .scss file it did not update my .css file in real-time. This problem took quite a while to track down.     
- Nesting keeps related functions in a hierarchical format, and was quick to implement. Mixins prevents D.R.Y! There were no examples of .css 'extend/inheritance', so I could not change 'theadviceshop' website code to the .scss format.
