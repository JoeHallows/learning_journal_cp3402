- Creat a 'safety net' to maintain focus and motivation, learn the core skills of any subject first, then learn what's hard and work through less and less important aspects of that subject. Anything else that you don't care learning about and/or is unimportant, don't learn.    
- When reading/learning in general, highlight key parts and make relevant notes during to revise after. Once these notes are taken, categorise them well to utilise or refer to later, creating a place outside your brain to store info, ideas, quotes, etc. A 'second brain' if you will.
