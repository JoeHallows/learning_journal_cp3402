- Creat a 'safety net' to maintain focus and motivation, learn the core skills of any subject first, then learn what's hard for you and work from more important stuff through to less and less important aspects of that subject. Anything else that you don't care learning about and/or is unimportant, don't learn.    
- When reading/learning in general, highlight key parts and make relevant notes during to revise after. Once these notes are taken, categorise them well to utilise or refer to later, creating a place outside your brain to store info, ideas, quotes, etc. A 'second brain' if you will.     
- He explains 9 tips to learn anything FASTER! 
1. Sharpen the axe (The power of preparation). 
2. Use crutches to optimise your focus (The 5-minute rule: convince yourself to focus on a task for only 5 minutes, and you can stop after that, although you will most likely keep doing that task.) 
3. Find opportunities for immersion (Immerse yourself! You learn best in the environment you're going to be using the skill)
4. Figure out what your weak links are (Spend time to fix the weak links in any area/subject/skill) 
5. Test yourself! (Conduct active recall: you don't learn by putting stuff into your brain, but by taking stuff out of it + The Desirable Difficulty Concept: Compete with someone at your level or at a slightly higher level for the best learning opportunities)
6. Get intense feedback often (Feedback as often & as quickly as possible! However, when starting out we need positivity & enthusiasm rather than critical feedback. Tight feedback loops - there and then - encourage learning)
7. Over-learning (Learn the area/subject/skill in more depth than necessary. continually ask 'why')
8. Spacing (Spaced repetition to counteract 'The forgetting curve': Repeat at spaced intervals)
9. Teach what you're learning ('The curse of knowledge': we learn best from people who are just one step ahead of us on the same journey. We prefer a guide to a guru, and rather be a guide than a guru.)
