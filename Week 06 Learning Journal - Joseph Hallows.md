- Creat a 'safety net' to maintain focus and motivation, learn the core skills of any subject first, then learn what's hard for you and work from more important stuff through to less and less important aspects of that subject. Anything else that you don't care learning about and/or is unimportant, don't learn.    
- When reading/learning in general, highlight key parts and make relevant notes during to revise after. Once these notes are taken, categorise them well to utilise or refer to later, creating a place outside your brain to store info, ideas, quotes, etc. A 'second brain' if you will.     
- Here are 9 tips to learn anything FASTER!:
1. Sharpen the axe (The power of preparation). 
2. Use crutches to optimise your focus (The 5-minute rule: convince yourself to focus on a task for only 5 minutes, and you can stop after that, although you will most likely keep doing that task.) 
3. Find opportunities for immersion (Immerse yourself! You learn best in the environment you're going to be using the skill)
4. Figure out what your weak links are (Spend time to fix the weak links in any area/subject/skill) 
5. Test yourself! (Conduct active recall: you don't learn by putting stuff into your brain, but by taking stuff out of it + The Desirable Difficulty Concept: Compete with someone at your level or at a slightly higher level for the best learning opportunities)
6. Get intense feedback often (Feedback as often & as quickly as possible! However, when starting out we need positivity & enthusiasm rather than critical feedback. Tight feedback loops - there and then - encourage learning)
7. Over-learning (Learn the area/subject/skill in more depth than necessary. continually ask 'why')
8. Spacing (Spaced repetition to counteract 'The forgetting curve': Repeat at spaced intervals)
9. Teach what you're learning ('The curse of knowledge': we learn best from people who are just one step ahead of us on the same journey. We prefer a guide to a guru, and rather be a guide than a guru.)         
- Use active recall! Instead of summarising/taking notes, write down questions for yourself to answer when revising. Helps you become better at retrieving info from your brain. Practice taking stuff out of your brain, rather than putting stuff in. Combine active recall & spaced repetition: repeatedly ask yourself questions over spaced intervals.     
- Learn through experience by doing projects instead of wasting your time only watching tutorials.      
- From a Social Media Marketing expert, create quality content that inspires, educates, and entertains! Grow your audience & build trust, become an authority, and generate more leads. Content gains traction which builds relationships! Creating strategic content is an essential marketing technique for any business.
- There are four phases in the content creation process: 
1. Ideation: Think big and get your ideas down! Crucial to be guided by research. What is your target audience looking for? What do they care about? What are some of their common question? What are they currently struggling with? What are their objections/common mistakes? Understand the competitor's content!
2. Planning: Take the ideas you've brainstormed & create a plan as to how to produce your content. Use a content calendar! sort ideas into 'pillars', Choose the platforms to use, and choose when to share your content. This will give you a sense of purpose and direction for each piece of content.
3. Creation: Make your ideas into actual content! Do content batching: create a bunch of content in advance to speed up workflow and save time. Work in chunks: work on one type of task in one chunk of time, which will improve focus, minimising going back and forth between multiple tasks.
4. Scheduling: Use a scheduling tool to publish content automatically on the right platforms at the right time. Once scheduled, it frees up time to focus on other work for your brand & business.
- The more relevant your content, the more likely your ideal audience will be interested in it. You can use 'Ubersuggest', a keyword research tool for brainstorming content ideas for your target audience in the ideation phase. It's not about producing more content, but producing better content that your target audience will want to respond to.
- Content calendars keeps your content organised, maintains consistency, reduced stress, helps you be strategic, and allows for collaboration. Use 'Airtable'!
- Use 'WordTune', an AI content creating tool for creating content!
- Use 'Canva' for social media graphics!
- Use 'Mojo' to create engaging video content!
- use 'Facebook Creator Studio' to automate posting!
# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I used these videos to assist me in becoming a better, faster and more reliant learner with techniques that will help me become a better student in this final year. 
This will transfer to my skills that I will utilise once I obtain a job in the IT field. These techniques will also give me more confidence in my work, meaning I will get better results in a shorter period of time.
I dived in more specifically to learning coding more effectively, and the final message was to undertake more projects to gain first-hand experience.
These experiences will definitely assist me if I have a job with any coding involved.
I also became curious about content strategies for social media, etc, so I looked at a short course on linkedIn, and the 4-step process really simplified to me the work needed to effectively use social media as a business tool, which I can use for almost any job.
