## GPT-4
- ChatGPT is a complicated AI that has the ability to correlate information from various internet sources and produce answers in relation to the question a user has asked.      
- This correlated info at the present time may not be accurate, so fact-checking is a priority to not use incorrect information for instances where accuracy is needed.      
- AI may seem impressive now, but this is simply the start of a powerful tool that will change how we access information via the internet.      
- The longer it has time to train, test, and produce information, the more accurate it will become.      
- AI will help users by offloading menial tasks to a system, rather than forcing the user to create it themselves.     
- AI combined with other technologies such as robots will reduce the amount of repetitive and even dangerous tasks humans must do at the present time.

## Study Tricks:       
- The best technique to practice is to encode what you are learning from your short-term (working) memory to long-term memory.        
- To retrieve the information needed, simple retrieve it from long-term memory back to working memory to have the working memory at your disposal.      
- The 'Forgetting Curve' is involved in any memory task.      
- Space the review of content by doubling the time between the next review (e.g. 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs, etc)

CHATGPT is quickly becoming a part of people's work in the field of IT, so I gathered that I should be accustomed to using AI tools effectively to assist me with IT tasks, and understand how AI works.         
I have heard from more than one source from people in the IT field that "AI will not replace people in the workforce, but people who use AI will replace people in the workforce"
