# Content Insights
- I previously wasn't aware of the difference between templates and themes and how to use them properly. The 'wpshout' article explicitly tells the difference between the two, more specifically templates and the 'WordPress Template Hierarchy'. 'index.php' is the final fallback template page file for the template hierarchy. Once the hierarchy is understood, you can make WordPress themes that benefit from this knowledge by simply creating and modifying the proper template files to affect the desired webpages.    
- Taught me how easy child themes are to create using a 'style.css' and 'functions.php' file. A child theme inherits all of its parent theme's aspects in terms of updates, but is up to me what I want to add to the child theme, giving me total power over customization.     
- Introduces what a parent and child theme are, and provides the aspects of the 'style.css' stylesheet to personally alter, and 'functions.php'. Through experience I know how quick and easy it is to create a child theme.
# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
With how skeptical I originally was about this practical, this showed me first-hand how quick and easy it is to create a child theme, which I can use to help me make themes and ultimately web pages/sites in the future. Also being taught about templates and using the template hierarchy, and with the added 45+ hours experience spent on the first assignment, I am much more confident when using templates and themes, and aim to use both whenever possible in future practicals/assignments to give me practice for future projects.
