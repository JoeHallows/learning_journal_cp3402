# Content Insights
From this introduction of Web Design & development, I have found that creating a website is a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Websites can either be made entirely from scratch, or from an abundance of templates that can be found online. Bootstrap gives you a multitude of templates to begin the web design journey.
# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Creating a website is relatively straightforward with the combination of templates and a background in coding (html, css and js). A job or career in web design is out of reach to people not knowledgeable, but from learning the basics, web design can be easy if done practically.
