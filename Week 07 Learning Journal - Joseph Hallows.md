# Content Insights
- Looking at data structures! Arrays, linked lists, hash tables, and how they store and link bits of memory.
- With linked lists, you can free one node at a time, instead of free-ing the whole list via arrays.     
- Hash tables are able to store large lists that can be built through binary trees.     
- e.g. storing names - A-Z = 1/26, Aa = 1/676, Aaa = 17,576      
- FIFO (First in first out - line for a restaurant)      
- LIFO (Last in first out - stack of trays)      
- With AI - "While AI can learn the 'how' to just about anything better than a human, it does not have the curiosity to ask 'why.'"     
- Basic cybersecurity terms, and who is involved (People, processes, and technologies)      
- Measuring EQ (Emotional Quotient - The emotional version of IQ) in 4 ways:     
1. Being aware of emotions     
2. Expressing emotions     
3. Controlling emotions     
4. Relationship management     
- 4 areas of EQ:      
1. Self-awareness     
2. self-management     
3. Social awareness     
4. Relationship development     
- Understanding and managing your emotions is critical!     
- Taking control! (2 parts):      
1. Accept your emotions

   5. Choose how to respond          
- You need to personally understand how you react to events!      
- Emotional hijacking: Trigger --> Emotions --> Irrational Response     
- Trigger(s) --> events/thoughts that consistently take you in the wrong direction       
- Flow --> Complete immersion in an activity        
- A - Activating Event (As an objective bystander)     
- B - Beliefs/Thoughts in relation to the event     
- C - Consequences     
- D - Disrupting thoughts (About replacing beliefs and feelings about the event with something more useful)     
- E - Effect    
- Break the chain between thinking/feeling and reacting   
- Tips to Broaden your Perspective (4 parts)!:      
1. Seek out different points of view      
2. Ask more questions      
3. Get acquainted with new people       
4. Read books on a variety of topics      
- Social Awareness: Being able to understand others and respond to their needs:

- When conveying empathy to another, use tentative, exploratory language, and words like 'possibly', and 'maybe'         
- Ultimately, people want to be understood, and want to make connections       
- Conversing is providing and gathering information      
- Listen! to: words, tone, and body language      
- Utilize your own unique style when managing relationships - Connect to build trust        
- Intent and key messages (Not exactly what you are going to say)        
- Cyber Kill Chain:     
1. Reconnaissance     
2. Weaponization     
3. Delivery     
4. Exploitation     
5. Installation     
6. Command and Control     
7. Action     
- Hacking/Malware types such as: Botnets, Trojans, Zeus, DDoS, Rootkit, phishing,  etc...
- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT): High degree of stealthiness and persist over a long period of time.     
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Core, Profile, Tiers)
1. Core: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover     
2. Profile: To align business outcomes and cybersecurity activities, providing a view of risks & development plan to bridge the two     
3. Tiers: Partial Implementation, Risk Informed, Repeatable, and Adaptive      
- Risk Management for an Advanced Risk Framework: Preparation, Categorization, Selection, Implementation, Assessment, Authorization, Monitoring     
- IoT (Internet of Things) Anything connected to the internet that sends or receives data     
- Global Internet Principles: Proportionality, Accessibility, Respect, Human Rights, Openness, Collaboration, Competition       
- Questioning assumptions, observing, and reflecting are how we can begin to adopt the mindset of strategic thinking.      
- Questions to ask:      
1. Where do I want to be in three to five years?     
2. Am I on track now?     
3. How can I increase my chances of success?     
- Tactics: The concrete activities you undertake to make your goals, and therefore your strategy, and therefore your vision, come to life.     
- Make a regular commitment to ask questions regarding your life and the big picture!      
- Is there more I should be aware of?     
- Follow current trends...     
- Good strategy doesn't have to be innovative!     
- Look at past successes in history!!        
- Consider the future trends in your industry!!!     
- Make sure to strategically cover blind spots by making a habit of looking for what they are and how to fix them.      
- We can learn to make better decisions and develop sharper strategies if we review our assumptions, check them against those milestones and see what we got right and wrong.     
- Check in with yourself quarterly (every 3 months) to ask whether you're heading in the right direction, and change your strategy accordingly if not.      
- Questions to Audit your Strategy:     
1. Are you failing to meet initial expectations?

3. Is there a more promising alternative?
