- Looking at data structures! Arrays, linked lists, hash tables, and how they store and link bits of memory.
- With linked lists, you can free one node at a time, instead of free-ing the whole list via arrays.     
- Hash tables are able to store large lists that can be built through binary trees.     
- e.g. storing names - A-Z = 1/26, Aa = 1/676, Aaa = 17,576      
- FIFO (First in first out - line for a restaurant)      
- LIFO (Last in first out - stack of trays)      
- With AI - "While AI can learn the 'how' to just about anything better than a human, it does not have the curiosity to ask 'why.'"     
- Basic cybersecurity terms, and who is involved (People, processes, and technologies)      
- Measuring EQ (Emotional Quotient - The emotional version of IQ) in 4 ways:     
1. Being aware of emotions     
2. Expressing emotions     
3. Controlling emotions     
4. Relationship management     
- 4 areas of EQ:      
1. Self-awareness     
2. self-management

4. Challenge your thoughts.        
5. Choose how to respond          
- You need to personally understand how you react to events!      
- Emotional hijacking: Trigger --> Emotions --> Irrational Response     
- Trigger(s) --> events/thoughts that consistently take you in the wrong direction       
- Flow --> Complete immersion in an activity        
- A - Activating Event (As an objective bystander)     
- B - Beliefs/Thoughts in relation to the event     
- C - Consequences     
- D - Disrupting thoughts (About replacing beliefs and feelings about the event with something more useful)     
- E - Effect    
- Break the chain between thinking/feeling and reacting
