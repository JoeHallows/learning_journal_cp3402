# Content Insights
- Looking at data structures! Arrays, linked lists, hash tables, and how they store and link bits of memory.
- With linked lists, you can free one node at a time, instead of free-ing the whole list via arrays.     
- Hash tables are able to store large lists that can be built through binary trees.     
- e.g. storing names - A-Z = 1/26, Aa = 1/676, Aaa = 17,576      
- FIFO (First in first out - line for a restaurant)      
- LIFO (Last in first out - stack of trays)      
- With AI - "While AI can learn the 'how' to just about anything better than a human, it does not have the curiosity to ask 'why.'"
